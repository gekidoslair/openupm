# Support OpenUPM

OpenUPM is an open-source service and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to host, maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing. You can support openupm development via the following methods:

## Help the Community Grow

Show your <i class="fa fa-heart text-error"></i> and support by

- <i class="fa fa-star text-warning"></i> Starring the [OpenUPM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openupm/openupm)
- <i class="fas fa-plus-circle text-primary"></i> [Hunting amazing UPM package](packages/add/)
- <i class="fas fa-bug text-success"></i> Reporting bug report or feature request on [openupm](https://github.com/openupm/openupm/issues) or [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli/issues) issues
- <i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> [Adding badge](/docs/adding-badge.md) to GitHub README file (for package creator)

## Donations

We accept donations on the following channels
- One-time donations through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/favoyang)
- Recurring pledges come with exclusive perks, e.g. having your name listed in the OpenUPM GitHub repository, or have your company logo placed on this website. [Become a backer or sponsor via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/openupm) goes directly to support Favo Yang's work on OpenUPM.
- Service sponsor for the company-provided equaled value of software or service comparing with the recurring pledges, and will receive the same level of rewards. Please contact [hello@openupm.com](mailto:hello@openupm.com) to start a conversation.

If you run a business and are using OpenUPM in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor OpenUPM development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.** It can also help your exposure in the OpenUPM community and makes it easier to attract OpenUPM developers.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using OpenUPM, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while :)
